LICENCE DETAILS

Grammar note: I am Australian, and the word "licence" (the noun) is spelt like that here, rather than "license". However when I am quoting from other documents the spelling "license" will probably be used.

This document summarizes the licences used for MUSHclient.

MUSHclient itself is licenced under The MIT License

  https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

The actual licence document is in the file: MUSHclient licence.txt

----

MUSHclient (like most software) uses other libraries written by other authors, who have assigned various licences to them. Often, the licence agreement itself must be included with software that uses such libraries. This folder of documents attempts to reproduce the various licences and comply with such requirements.
